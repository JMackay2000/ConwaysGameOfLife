## Instructions

Initially, you can draw on the screen using the left mouse button, and clear using the right mouse button. Just hold down either and draw on the blank canvas.
Each white square represents an individual cell that will behave according to the rules outlined by Conway in his Game of Life.

Press space bar to start/stop the simulation.

At any point in the simulation, you can resize the screen like any other window by going to the corners and dragging the window in the desired direction.
- NOTE: can cause illformed cells.

When the simulation is paused, you can also clear the canvas using the R key, save using the S key and typing the save file name in the terminal or similarly load a file using the L key.

To exit the simulation, ensure the simulation is paused and press the Q key.
